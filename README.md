# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions, thereby helping financial institutions mitigate financial losses and enhance customer trust.

The core challenge lies in the highly **imbalanced nature** of the dataset, where fraudulent transactions are a rare event. The goal is to build a model that maximizes the detection of true fraud cases (high recall) while minimizing the flagging of legitimate transactions as fraudulent (high precision and low false positives).

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build and deploy a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting fraudulent credit card transactions, with an emphasis on **maximizing fraud detection (Recall)** while **minimizing false positives** to avoid disrupting legitimate customer activities.

## 🗃️ Data Dictionary

The model uses the following features to classify a transaction as legitimate (0) or fraudulent (1):

| Column Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `distance_from_home` | Distance from the cardholder's home to the transaction location |
| `distance_from_last_transaction` | Distance from the previous transaction |
| `ratio_to_median_purchase_price` | Ratio of transaction value to the median purchase price |
| `repeat_retailer` | Whether the transaction was from a repeat retailer (1: Yes, 0: No) |
| `used_chip` | Whether a chip was used in the transaction (1: Yes, 0: No) |
| `used_pin_number` | Whether a PIN number was used (1: Yes, 0: No) |
| `online_order` | Whether the transaction was online (1: Yes, 0: No) |
| **`fraud`** | **Target variable:** Indicates if the transaction was fraudulent (1: Fraud, 0: Legitimate) |

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x

### Dependencies

This project requires the following libraries, as listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
streamlit
joblib
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## Data Preprocessing  

### Missing Data  
We checked for missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`. Missing data was imputed or removed based on its significance.

### Outlier Detection and Handling  
Outliers were detected using box plots for key columns:  
- `distance_from_home`  
- `distance_from_last_transaction`  
- `ratio_to_median_purchase_price`  

To handle outliers, we capped values using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method via a custom `cap_outliers` function. This ensured that extreme values did not skew the model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Plotted to examine relationships between features.  
- **Class Distribution:** Checked the balance of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions in the `fraud` column.  

---

## Feature Engineering  
1. **Distance Ratio:** Calculated the ratio of `distance_from_home` to `distance_from_last_transaction`.  
2. **Transaction Score:** Combined multiple features to create a transaction risk score.  
3. **Purchase Category:** Grouped transactions based on `ratio_to_median_purchase_price` into categories:  
   - `very_low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high`  
4. **Encoding:** Encoded purchase categories using a custom function to make them model-ready.

## Feature Selection, Train-Test Split & Scaling  
- Selected significant features based on correlation analysis.  
- Split the dataset into training and test sets using an 80-20 ratio.  
- Applied **Standard Scaler** for feature normalization.

## Conclusion  
Our credit card fraud detection model demonstrated a significant ability to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, we developed a robust solution capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

### Key Insights:  
- **Fraud Detection Efficiency:** The model consistently identified fraudulent transactions with minimal false positives, reducing potential financial losses for credit card companies and enhancing customer trust.  
- **Impact on Fraud Prevention:** By accurately detecting fraudulent transactions, financial institutions can minimize disruptions to legitimate transactions, improving the overall user experience.  
- **High-Risk Factors:** Features like unusually high transaction distances and online orders showed strong correlations with fraud, offering valuable indicators for real-time monitoring systems.

### Recommendations:  
1. **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implementing this model in a real-time transaction monitoring system can help flag high-risk transactions promptly, reducing fraud-related losses.  
2. **Continuous Model Updating:** Regular updates with new transaction data will ensure the model adapts to emerging fraud patterns.  
3. **Customer Awareness:** Educating customers about common fraud triggers, such as unusual transaction patterns and PIN security, can further strengthen fraud prevention.  
4. **Integration with Multi-Layer Security:** This model should complement other security measures, such as two-factor authentication, to enhance fraud detection and prevention.

By integrating this machine learning-based solution into financial systems, organizations can strengthen their defenses against fraud, ensuring both security and a seamless customer experience.
